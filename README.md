# Base46

> You could say 16 colors is enough, and yeah, it is enough.
> However, more is more.
> The more, the better.
> That is why we decided that 46 colors is perfect.

**Base46 is simply a lua library for setting themes in [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)**

- Forked from https://github.com/zahimeen/base46.nvim
- Which was forked from https://github.com/NvChad
- Which was forked from https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-base16.lua

## Usage

### Install

- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  ```lua
  use "zahimeen/nvim-base46.lua"
  ```
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  ```vim
  Plug "zahimeen/nvim-base46.lua"
  ```
- **Or Just Use Any Plugin Manager You Like**
- **Or Just Use Any Method You Like**

### Set Theme

- `base`: (type string) The amount of colors you want in your theme ("base16" for 16 colors | "base46" for 46 colors).
- `theme`: (type string) The name of the theme you desire. You can find out what themes are available by going into `./lua/base46/hl_themes/`.
- `transparency`: (type bool) Do you want transparency or not?
 
```lua
-- exit if it can't be found
local present, base46 = pcall(require, "base46")
if not present then
   return
end

local theme_opts = {
   base = "base46",
   theme = "tomorrownight",
   transparency = false,
}

base46.load_theme(theme_opts)
```

## Contribute Themes

- Themes are placed in the `./lua/base46/hl_themes/` directory.
- To create a new theme, create a lua file with the name of the theme you want it to be (the file name should be all lowercase for the sake of consistency).
- All colors in the theme must be in a `#RRGGBB` hex  code format.
- **Example**: *tomorrownight.lua*

```lua
local M = {}

M.base_30 = {
   white = "#C5C8C2",

## Understand Theme Variables

- Use a color lightening/darkening tool, such as this https://siduck.github.io/hex-tools/

```
black = usually your theme bg 
darker_black = 6% darker than black
black2 = 6% lighter than black

onebg = 10% lighter than black
oneb2 = 19% lighter than black
oneb3 = 27% lighter than black

grey = 40% lighter than black (the % here depends so choose the perfect grey!)
grey_fg = 10% lighter than grey
grey_fg2 = 20% lighter than grey
light_grey = 28% lighter than grey

baby_pink = 15% lighter than red or any babypink color you like!
line = 15% lighter than black 

nord_blue = 13% darker than blue 
sun = 8% lighter than yellow

statusline_bg = 4% lighter than black
lightbg = 13% lighter than statusline_bg
lightbg2 = 7% lighter than statusline_bg

folder_bg = blue color

(note: the above values are mostly approx values so its not compulsory that you have to use those exact numbers , test your theme i.e show it in the PR to get feedback from @zahimeen)
