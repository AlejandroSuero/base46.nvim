# Base46

> You could say 16 colors is enough, and yeah, it is enough.
> However, more is more.
> The more, the better.
> That is why we decided that 46 colors is perfect.

**Base46 is simply a lua library for setting themes in [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)**

- This plugin is a complete re-write of [Norcalli's](https://github.com/norcalli) [base16](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-base16.lua) plugin.
- It was originally supposed to only be used for [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad) but I decided that it should be easy accessible to any [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration. **The Power of Open Source and Free Software** (I don't really know the details but I heard projects that have these factors are better). However, this plugin does not have all the features the [original](https://github.com/NvChad/base46) one has.

## Usage

### Install

- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  ```lua
  use "zahimeen/nvim-base46.lua"
  ```
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  ```vim
  Plug "zahimeen/nvim-base46.lua"
  ```
- **Or Just Use Any Plugin Manager You Like**
- **Or Just Use Any Method You Like**

### Set Theme

- The first parameter for `load_theme` determines the amount of colors used of the theme ("base16" for 16 colors | "base46" for 46 colors).
- The second parameter for `load_theme` is the theme name. You can find out what themes are available by going into `./lua/base46/hl_themes/`
 
```lua
local base46 = require("base46")
local base_num = "base46"
local theme_name = "tomorrownight"

base46.load_theme(base_num, theme_name)
```

## Contribute Themes

- Themes are placed in the `./lua/base46/hl_themes/` directory.
- To create a new theme, create a lua file with the name of the theme you want it to be (the file name should be all lowercase for the sake of consistency).
- All colors in the theme must be in a `#RRGGBB` hex  code format.
- **Example**: *tomorrownight.lua*

```lua
local M = {}

M.base30 = {

## Understand Theme Variables

- Use a color lightening/darkening tool, such as this https://siduck.github.io/hex-tools/

```
black = usually your theme bg 
darker_black = 6% darker than black
black2 = 6% lighter than black

onebg = 10% lighter than black
oneb2 = 19% lighter than black
oneb3 = 27% lighter than black

grey = 40% lighter than black (the % here depends so choose the perfect grey!)
grey_fg = 10% lighter than grey
grey_fg2 = 20% lighter than grey
light_grey = 28% lighter than grey

baby_pink = 15% lighter than red or any babypink color you like!
line = 15% lighter than black 

nord_blue = 13% darker than blue 
sun = 8% lighter than yellow

statusline_bg = 4% lighter than black
lightbg = 13% lighter than statusline_bg
lightbg2 = 7% lighter than statusline_bg

folder_bg = blue color

(note: the above values are mostly approx values so its not compulsory that you have to use those exact numbers , test your theme i.e show it in the PR to get feedback from @zahimeen)
